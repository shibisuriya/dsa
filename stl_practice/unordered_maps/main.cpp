// # Unordered maps
// - Unordered maps and maps have the same inteface.
// - Unordered maps don't keep their keys sorted... The are implemented using hash tables
// not trees.
// - The time complexity of reading/writing an item in an unordered map is
// O(1).
// Only data types that have a native hashing function available can be used as keys in an unordered_map.
